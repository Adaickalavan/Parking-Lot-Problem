# Parking Lot Problem

See [website](https://adaickalavan.github.io/portfolio/parking_lot_problem/) for information.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Go**
    + Install Go following the instructions [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
    + Set `GOROOT` which is the location of your Go installation. Assuming it is installed at `$HOME/go2.x`, execute:
        ```
        export GOROOT=$HOME/go2.x
        export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
        ```
    + Set `GOPATH` environment variable which specifies the location of your Go workspace. It defaults to `$HOME/go` on Unix/Linux.
        ```
        export GOPATH=$HOME/go
        ```
    + Set `GOBIN` path for generation of binary file when `go install` is run.
        ```
        export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
        export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
        ```
2. **Source code**
    + Unzip `project.zip` into a `project` folder
    + Copy and paste the entire `project/src/parking_lot` folder into `$GOPATH/src/` folder in your computer
    + Copy and paste the entire `project/bin/setup` file into `$GOPATH/bin/` folder in your computer
  
3. **Executable**
    + To create an executable in the `$GOPATH/bin/` directory, execute
        ```
        go install parking_lot
        ```
4. **Unit test and functional test**
    + To run complete test suite, run
        ```
        go test -v parking_lot
        ```
        Here, `-v` is the verbose command flag.
    + To run specific test, run
        ```
        go test -v parking_lot -run xxx
        ```
        Here, `xxx` is the name of test function.
    + Test coverage: 94.1% of statements
5. **Running**
    + Launch interactive user input mode by executing
        ```
        $GOPATH/bin/parking_lot
        ```
    + Launch file input mode by executing
        ```
        $GOPATH/bin/parking_lot.exe $GOPATH/src/parking_lot/inputFile.txt
        ```
        Here, `$GOPATH/src/parking_lot/inputFile.txt` refers to the input file with complete path.

## Project structure

The project structure is as follows:

```txt

```

## Notes on solution

1. **Data structures**
   + A hash map and a min heap was used to solve the parking lot problem.

2. **Complexity**
    + To park a car: O(log(n1)). Here, n1 is the size of the min heap.
    + To remove a car: O(log(n1)). Here, n1 is the size of the min heap.
    + To retrieve a car by colour: O(n2). Here, n2 is the size of the hash map.
    + To retrieve a car by registration number: O(n2). Here, n2 is the size of the hash map.
    + To get status: O(n2). Here, n2 is the size of the hash map.

3. **Assumptions and rationale for choice of data structures to optimize complexity**
    + Car parking and removing operations will be more frequent compared to retrieving car by colour/registration number or status requests.
    + A hash map with `slot number` as `key` is used to store all the cars parked in the carpark. Complexity O(1) of hash map simplifies insertion and removal of cars by slot number.
    + A min heap is used to store *previoulsy-occupied-but-now-empty* slots in ordered sequence with complexity O(log(n1)) for push and pop operations. Here, *empty slots n1 refer only to slots which were previously occupied but is now free*. It does not refer to the total number of free slots in the carpark.

4. **Alternative solutions to reduce complexity at the expense of increased memory**
    + To achieve complexity O(1) in retrieving a car by colour, implement an additional hash map with `colour` as `key` to store all the cars parked in the carpark.
    + To achieve complexity O(1) in retrieving a car by registration number, implement an additional hash map with `registration number` as `key` to store all the cars parked in the carpark.
